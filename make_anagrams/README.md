# Make Anagram

We consider two strings to be anagrams of each other if the first string's letters can be rearranged to form the second string.
In other words, both strings must contain the same exact letters in the same exact frequency.
For example, bacdc and dcbac are anagrams, but bacdc and dcbad are not.
Given two strings, a and b, that may or may not be of the same length, determine the minimum number of character deletions required to make a and b anagrams.

Example: 
Input: a='cde', b='abc'
Output 4
